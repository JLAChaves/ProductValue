This program is the solution to an exercise proposed in the C# course I'm doing. It is necessary to create a program that reads an N number of products, then it is necessary to show the price tag of each product in the same order in which they were entered. It is also necessary to consider that every product has a name and price, and imported products have a customs fee and used products have a date of manufacture.
